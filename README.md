# music-playlist-scraper
This project is an automated bot (scraper) developed in Node.js to monitor and download the track list (playlist) from the RaiPlay Sound radio show "Battiti." The main goal is to maintain a complete historical archive of the songs and generate a file ready for incremental import into a TIDAL playlist.
